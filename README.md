# Caffe for MSG-Net (Multi-scale guidance network)
This is the release of MSG-Net for the paper Depth Map Super-Resolution by Deep Multi-Scale Guidance in ECCV16. It comes with 4 trained networks (x2, x4, x8, x16) and 3 testing sets (A, B, C).

To the best of our knowledge, MSG-Net is the FIRST paper which uses convolution neural network (CNN) for upsampling depth images with the multi-scale guidance from the corresponding high-resolution RGB images.

# Dependency
We train our models using <a href="https://github.com/BVLC/caffe">caffe</a> and evaluate the results on Matlab.

# Installation and Running
You need to install <a href="https://github.com/BVLC/caffe">caffe</a> and remeber to complie matcaffe. You can put the folder <code>MSGNet-release</code> in <code>caffe/examples</code>. Finally, you need to get into the the directory of <code>examples/MSGNet-release</code>, and run <code>MSGNet.m</code>. </li>

# Training data
Our <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/p45abqvpzv66m2p/AACwDh0iIu67Us3IPLusfPXXa?dl=0e">RGBD training set</a> consists of 58 RGBD images from <a href="http://sintel.is.tue.mpg.de/depth">MPI Sintel depth dataset</a>, and 34 RGBD images from <a href="http://vision.middlebury.edu/stereo/data/">Middlebury dataset</a>. 82 images are used for training and 10 images (frames 1, 20, 28, 58, 64, 66, 69, 73, 75 and 79) are used for validation.
